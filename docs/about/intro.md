## Vision

Providing affordable finance to entrepreneurs is a crucial condition for further growth of micro and small companies, contributing to economic growth and a dignified life for entrepreneurs, their employees and families. We believe merchant finance based on real orders and delivery is the best way to loan to low-income clients because it limits default risks. We believe using new digital technologies can unleash the full potential of this model.

## Mission

We empower entrepreneurs with access to ethical and affordable credit to grow their business.
