## Step 5: Take a Selfie Picture.

**NOTE:** When taking the selfie, hold the camera steady without turning your head. Try to remain still as much as possible – it won’t take long!

## Step 6: 	Take a picture of your ID card: both front and back

**NOTE:** Take a picture of the ID in a well-lit environment.  Ensure all four corners of the document are visible, and there are no reflections (if your phone’s flashlight is on, be sure to switch it off). Clean the lens, hold the phone steady, and align the camera for your ID to fit the frame. Proceed to take the picture and ensure that the information on it is legible. If you’re not sure of the quality, you can retake the photo.

## Step 7:	Create your Sevi App Passcode
After successfully going through the KYC process, the last step is to create a four-digit password for your Sevi App. 

**NOTE:** This passcode will be used to log in to your Sevi APP. Kindly memorize it or write it down on a piece of paper or save it on your mobile device.

## ALL DONE!!
You should now be logged into your Sevi App. Congratulations
