# Prepaid Plan

The **Prepaid Plan** is a new subscription option that allows frequent borrowers to save on transaction fees and borrow more flexibly.  

Instead of paying a fee for every loan, you pay a **single upfront fee once a month**, and can borrow multiple times within your credit limit without extra charges per loan.  


## Benefits
- Saves money on transaction fees.  
- Gives freedom to borrow whenever needed.  
- Makes cash flow planning easier for your business.  


## How It Works
1. Pay a one-time **Prepaid Fee** for the month (varies depending on your limit).  
2. Borrow as many times as you want within your credit limit.  
3. The plan is valid for **one month** — renew monthly to keep enjoying the benefit.  


## Eligibility
Not every buyer is eligible immediately. To join, you must:  
- Have used Sevi for at least **6 months**.  
- Pay your loans on time.  
- Have traded at least once in the last month.  


## Important Notes
- The Prepaid fee is **non-refundable**, even if you don’t borrow that month.  
- Works best for customers who borrow **frequently**.  
- If you don’t pay your loan on time, **normal delinquency rates** apply.  


## Joining the Plan
- Currently, you can join by contacting the **Sevi Call Center** [0709 924 424](tel:0709924424).  
- Soon, you will be able to subscribe **directly in the app**.  


## Without the Prepaid Plan
You can still borrow normally — but you’ll pay standard **transaction fees per loan**.
