# How to Use USSD

You can access Sevi services without the app by dialing **`*789*7788#`**.  
The menu you see depends on your account status.

## 1. What You See When You Dial

### **A. Credit Customers (With Active Orders)**
If you have unpaid orders, you will immediately see:

```text
Pay orders
a. selling company - 2000 KES - PENDING - 06/26/2025
b. selling company - 1500 KES - PENDING - 06/26/2025
c. selling company - 2200 KES - DUE - 06/26/2025
d. selling company - 2200 KES - LATE - 06/26/2025
e. selling company - 3402 KES - PAID - 07/04/2025

9. Other options
```

Select an order → choose payment method (`M-Pesa`, `Sevi Wallet`, or `Sevi Credit`) →  
If paying via Sevi Wallet or Sevi Credit: enter your Sevi PIN → payment completes.

### **B. Verified / Non-Verified Customers With No Orders**
If you have no active orders, you will see the Main Menu:

```text

2. Verify Payment

### **C. Non-Verified Customers With Pending Direct Pay**
If a seller or agent sents you a direct-pay request:
