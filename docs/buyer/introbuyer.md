# Get Started as a Buyer

With Sevi, you don’t have to tie up your cash in stock — simply **Order Now, Pay Later** from verified suppliers.  


## 1. When Your Supplier is Verified
If your supplier is already verified on Sevi, getting started is simple:  

1. **Register** your account on Sevi. [Check Step by step process](/buyer/step-by-step-process/register)  
2. **Place an Order** with your supplier.  
3. **Select a Payment Plan** (Pay Later or Pay Directly).  

It’s that easy! 🎉

## 2. When Your Supplier is Not Yet Verified
To use Sevi, your supplier must be a **verified partner**.  

If your supplier is not yet on the platform, you can easily **invite them** by sending a message via their **WhatsApp** or **Email**.  

Once they join and get verified, you’ll be able to place orders and use Sevi’s flexible payment options.
