# Cashback

Sevi rewards you with cashback when you make repayments on time. The program has two phases: **Early Rewards** and **Mid-Term Rewards**.  


## Early Rewards  
- Applies **before 50% of your repayment term**.  
- You can receive **30% cashback** on the total fees paid so far.  


## Mid-Term Rewards  
- Applies when youâ€™ve paid **between 50% and 80% of your repayment term**.  
- You can receive **10% cashback** on the total fees paid so far.  


## Summary  
- Pay early = higher cashback (30%).  
- Pay mid-term = smaller cashback (10%).  
- These rewards are designed to encourage consistent and timely repayments.  


:::tip
Always pay on time (or early) to maximize your cashback benefits.
