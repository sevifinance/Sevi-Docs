# Understanding Credit Limits

Your ability to use **Order Now, Pay Later** depends on the credit limits set by Sevi.  
These limits are based on your **track record** (as a buyer) and your supplier’s (seller).  

If you reach a limit, you won’t see the Pay Later option — only **Direct Pay** will be available.  


## Common Credit Limit Messages

Here are the most common messages you might see and what they mean:  

### Seller Reached Maximum Limit
**Message:** *Seller reached max of outstanding instalments*  
- Your supplier has too many open orders on credit.  
- This limit is shared across all their buyers.  
**What to do:** Contact your supplier. Once their track record improves, their limit will increase.  


### Buyer Has Overdue Instalments
**Message:** *Buyer should first pay the open instalments*  
- You (or your business) have unpaid instalments past the due date.  
- Can also include overdue instalments from other suppliers on Sevi.  
**What to do:** Clear overdue payments to unlock Pay Later.  


### Order Above Your Personal Limit
**Message:** *Order amount exceeds allowed buyer personal limit*  
- Your combined orders are too high for your current credit profile.  
- This applies if you’re ordering as an individual or sole proprietor.  
**What to do:** Pay off some existing orders, or consider upgrading to a company account.  


### Order Above Company Limit
**Message:** *Order amount exceeds allowed buyer company limit*  
- Your company has reached its maximum credit exposure across Sevi.  
**What to do:** Clear some existing instalments to regain access to Pay Later.  


### Seller Has Too Many Late Instalments
**Message:** *Seller exceeds more than 25% late instalments*  
- More than 25% of your supplier’s instalments are overdue.  
- Sevi temporarily blocks new Pay Later orders until the supplier’s performance improves.  
**What to do:** Contact your supplier for more details.  


## How to Increase Your Limit
- Always **pay on time or early**.  
- Upload updated **M-Pesa or Merchant statements** in the Growth section.  
- Order regularly and responsibly.
