# Step 2: Order products
As a buyer you have the chance to order from your supplier web shop and pay using Sevi's Order now, Pay later. However, you have to ensure that your supplier is a verified partner of Sevi. In some cases your supplier might not have a web shop, but they will create an order for you, which then shows up in the 'order' section of your Sevi account.

## Making Purchases

On your suppliers’ web-shop, select the products you wish to purchase and add them to the Cart. 

## Check-Out

At checkout of the web shop, select Sevi as your preferred Payment Option.
