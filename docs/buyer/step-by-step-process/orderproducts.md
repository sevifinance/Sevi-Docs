# Step 3: Create a Payment Request (Place an Order)

As a buyer, you can place an order with your supplier (seller) in two ways:  

1. **Through a supplier’s online shop (integrated with Sevi API)**  
2. **Through a manual payment request created by your agent or supplier**  

In both cases, the order will appear in your Sevi App for you to confirm and choose a payment plan.  


## Option 1: Ordering via Supplier Web-Shop  
If your supplier has an online shop connected to Sevi:  

1. Visit the supplier’s web-shop.  
2. Select the products you want to purchase and add them to your cart.  
3. At checkout, choose **Sevi** as your payment method.

:::caution
Make sure the phone number you enter at checkout is the **same one linked to your Sevi account**. Otherwise, your order won’t sync.

After checkout, you’ll receive a notification in your Sevi app with the order details.  


## Option 2: Ordering via Agent or Supplier (Manual Request)  
If your supplier doesn’t have a web-shop:  

1. The supplier (or their agent) will create a **Payment Request** on your behalf.  
2. You’ll be notified via SMS and in-app notification.  
3. Open your Sevi app → go to the **Payments** section or under important actions.  
4. Tap `Confirm` to Review the order details (Order Amount, Pay Later Amount, From Supplier, Order Number, Payment Option).

## Next Step: Confirm & Choose Payment Plan  
Once your order appears in Sevi (from either method), you must confirm and select how to pay:  
- **Pay Later** (Order Now, Pay Later).  
- **Pay Directly** (instant payment via M-Pesa).  

:::caution
Kindly tap `Confirm & Pay` once the order has been delivered to your Shop. (Depending on your Supplier Terms)
