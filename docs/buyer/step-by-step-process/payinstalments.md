# Step 4: Repay Your Credit  

Sevi makes it simple to manage and repay your credit.  
Youâ€™ll receive **SMS reminders** and **push notifications** so you never miss a due date.  


## Auto-Collection  
- On the due date, instalments are **automatically deducted** from your Sevi wallet.  
- Always make sure your wallet has enough balance.
