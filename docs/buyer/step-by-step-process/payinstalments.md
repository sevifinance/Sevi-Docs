# Step 4: Repay Your Credit  

Sevi makes it simple to manage and repay your credit.  
You’ll receive **SMS reminders** and **push notifications** so you never miss a due date.  


## Auto-Collection  
- On the due date, instalments are **automatically deducted** from your Sevi wallet.  
- Always make sure your wallet has enough balance.

2. Select a specific payment request credit to view its details:

:::caution
Ensure your Sevi wallet has enough balance **before the due date** to avoid failed or late payments.  
:::  


## Pay Early  
Want to clear your balance before the due date?  
- Go to **Payments**.  
- Tap **Pay** or **Repay** to make an early payment.  

:::tip
Paying early builds trust with Sevi and can help increase your credit limit.  
:::  


## Late Payments  
- A **late fee** is applied to overdue repayments.  
- Continuous late payments may block you from using Sevi credit in the future.  
- For more details, see our [Terms & Conditions](/termsConditions).
