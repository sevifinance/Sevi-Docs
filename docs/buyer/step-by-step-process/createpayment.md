# Step 3: Create a Payment Request  

As a buyer, you can make payments to your supplier (seller) in two ways:  

1. **Through a manual payment request created by your agent or supplier**  
2. **Through a supplier’s online shop (integrated with Sevi API)**  

In both cases, the **Payment Request** will appear in your Sevi App for you to review and confirm.  


## Option 1: Payment via Agent or Supplier (Manual Request)  
If your supplier doesn’t have a web-shop or ERP integrated:  

1. The supplier (or their agent) will create a **Payment Request** on your behalf.  
2. You’ll be notified via SMS and in-app notification.  
3. Open your Sevi app → go to the **Payments** section or under Important Actions.  
4. Tap `Confirm` to review the payment details (Order Amount, Pay Later Amount, Supplier Name, Order Number, Payment Option).

## Option 2: Payment via Supplier Web-Shop
If your supplier has an online shop connected with Sevi:  

1. Visit the supplier’s web-shop.  
2. Select the products you want to purchase and add them to your cart.  
3. At checkout, choose **Sevi** as your payment method.

:::caution
Make sure the phone number you enter at checkout is the **same one linked to your Sevi account**. Otherwise, your payment request won’t sync.  
:::  

After checkout, you’ll receive a notification in your Sevi app with the payment details.  


## Next Step: Confirm & Choose Payment Option  
Once your payment request appears in Sevi (from either method), you must confirm and select how to pay:  
- **Pay Later** (Order Now, Pay Later on credit).  
- **Pay Directly** (instant payment via M-Pesa).  

:::caution
Kindly tap `Confirm & Pay` once your goods have been delivered by the supplier. (Depending on your Supplier Terms)
