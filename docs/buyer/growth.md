# Grow Your Credit Limit

Your credit limit with Sevi grows as you build trust and demonstrate consistent business activity.  
Here’s how you can improve and expand your limit.  


## 1. Upload Updated Statements
To strengthen your profile, upload financial documents directly in the **Growth** screen:  
- **M-Pesa Statements** → Always upload the latest 6 months full statement.  
- **Merchant Statements** → If you use **M-Pesa Till** or other business accounts, upload your monthly reports.  

:::tip
The more up-to-date your statements are, the more accurately Sevi can assess and increase your limit.

## 2. Order Consistently
Regular business orders show reliability.  

- Placing **12 orders in a row** that are **10% above your current credit limit** will automatically trigger a credit review.  
- If consistent, your **limit will grow step by step**.

### Settlement Account  
When you withdraw funds from your Sevi wallet (using the **Send** button on your dashboard), the payout will be sent to your chosen settlement account.  
You can set:  
- Bank Account  
- M-Pesa Phone Number  
- M-Pesa Till

### Next of Kin  
- Add a trusted contact person.  
- Provide their **Name** and **Phone Number**.

This ensures your account has a secondary contact in case of emergencies.  


## ✅ Best Practices to Grow Faster
- Always **repay on time or early**.  
- Keep your **M-Pesa or Merchant statements updated**.  
- Order regularly to show consistent business activity.

The stronger your profile, the higher your credit limit and the better your chances of unlocking bigger opportunities with Sevi.
