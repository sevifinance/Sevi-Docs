An **M-Pesa pop-up** will appear on your phone.  
Confirm the details and enter your **M-Pesa PIN**.  

Funds will be deposited instantly into your Sevi wallet.  


## Step 3: Confirm Balance  
- Once the payment is complete, your new balance will reflect in your Sevi wallet.  
- If it doesn’t show right away, simply **pull down to refresh** the app.
