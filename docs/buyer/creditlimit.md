# Credit limits

Based on the track record of both the Seller and the Buyer the specific credit limits are defined by the Sevi system.

When you reach on of these limits you will not be able to pay products on credit. Only the 'direct pay' option shows when selecting a payment option. 

You will receive one of the following error messages when you or your buyer reaches a credit limit.

    Seller reached max of outstanding instalments
This means your Seller has reached  max 'Order now, Pay later' limit. This is the sum of all open instalments of all  buyers combined. Please contact your Seller. By a positive track record on Sevi this limit will increase overtime.

    Buyer should first pay the open instalments
You have open installments which are not paid before the due date. Please first pay these overdue instalments, to be able to use 'Order now, Pay later'. This can also be overdue instalments on orders at another Seller. More information on [how to pay instalments](/docs/buyer/step-by-step-process/payinstalments). 

    Order amount exceeds allowed buyer personal limit
