# Payment Plans  

When approving a payment request through Sevi, you can choose from the following payment options:  


## 1. Weekly Pay (Pay Later)  
- Split your repayment into **weekly instalments**.  
- Each week, Sevi automatically collects the due amount from your Sevi wallet.  
- You’ll receive SMS and push notifications before every collection date.  


## 2. Direct Pay  
- Pay the **full payment amount immediately** from your Sevi wallet or via M-Pesa.  
- Works the same as a cash payment.  


## Things to Note  
- Your repayment plan is shown clearly **before you confirm a payment request**.  
- Late payments may attract **additional fees**.  
- Consistently paying on time helps grow your **credit limit**.  


## Example  
Suppose you approve a payment request worth **KSh 3,000** under **Weekly Pay**:  
- Sevi may apply a small risk or service fee.  
- The remaining balance is spread across equal weekly instalments until the full amount is cleared.  


:::tip
Choose the plan that best fits your cash flow:  
- **Direct Pay** → best when you have enough funds in your wallet.  
- **Weekly Pay** → best when you need to spread out repayment over time.
