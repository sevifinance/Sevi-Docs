# Payment Plans

When placing an order through Sevi, you can choose from the following payment options:


## 1. Weekly Pay (Order Now, Pay Later)
- Split your payment into **weekly instalments**.  
- Each week, Sevi automatically collects the due amount from your Sevi account.  
- Youâ€™ll be reminded via SMS and push notifications before every collection date.  

## 2. Direct Pay
- Pay the **full order amount immediately** from your Sevi account or via M-Pesa.  
- Works the same as a cash payment.    


## Things to Note:
- Your repayment plan is shown clearly before confirming your order.  
- Late payments may attract additional fees.  
- Consistently paying on time grows your credit limit over time.  


## Example
Suppose you place an order worth **KSh 3,000** under **Weekly Pay**:  
- Sevi may require a small risk or service fee.  
- The balance is spread across equal weekly instalments until the full amount is cleared.  


:::tip
Choose the plan that best fits your cash flow. Direct Pay works best when you have enough balance, while Weekly Pay helps spread the cost of larger orders.
