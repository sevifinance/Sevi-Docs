# Refresh Data

Sometimes, after you perform an action, you may not immediately see the changes on your screen. Don’t worry — you can refresh the data in two ways:


## 1. Pull Down to Refresh
- Tap and hold anywhere on the screen.  
- Drag down until you see a rotating arrow.  
- Release to refresh and load the latest data.  


## 2. Restart the App
- If pull-to-refresh doesn’t work on your device, close the app completely and reopen it.  
- This will fetch the latest updates for you.
