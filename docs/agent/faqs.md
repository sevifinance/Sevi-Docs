# Agent FAQs

Here are some common questions agents (seller reps) ask while using Sevi:  


## 1. I don’t see my latest actions (orders, payments, customers). What should I do?
- Try **pulling down the screen** to refresh.  
- If that doesn’t work, **close and reopen the app**.  


## 2. How do I know if my buyer is verified?
- When first added, buyers show up as **PENDING**.  
- When initial registration steps are completed, buyers show up as **WAITING ON**.  
- After our due diligence team visits and verifies them, they appear as **ACTIVE**.  
- At this point, your incentive is released to your wallet.  


## 3. I onboarded a buyer but I haven’t received my incentive. Why?
- Incentives (KES 300 per buyer) are only released **after verification** by Sevi’s due diligence team.  
- Ensure Limit of the buyer have been **SET** and given a minimum limit able to Trade.  
- Once verified, the incentive will appear in your **wallet account** and can be withdrawn after seller activation.

The Agent that completes fully the onboarding of the buyer is the one the system will reward the incentives.
