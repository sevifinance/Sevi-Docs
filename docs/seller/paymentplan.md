# Step 3: Select payment plan

On behalf of your customer you select a payment plan for your customer to pay for the order over a certain period of time. 

## Go to customer section
Go to your `Company account`, then click `Customers` to go the customer section. Here you find an overview of all registered customers. If your customer is not yet registered please go to [step 1](/docs/seller/register) first.

Click on the relevant customers name.

This section will give you an overview of all orders of your customer and their status. A new order has status *pending* which means you still have to select a payment plan.

- number of instalments to be made
- instalment interval (weekly or monthly)
- fees for using the payment plan
- amount per instalment
- deposit amount

## Verify payment
Click `Verify payment` to verify the selected payment plan with your customer. Your customer is send a verification code (OTP) by SMS, to give its consent with the order and selected payment plan. Please ask you customer for this verification code (OTP) and fill it out. 

> **NOTE:** when you verify the payment plan with your customer, we verify whether your customer has sufficient balance in its Sevi account to pay for the deposit. When the balance of their Sevi account does not suffice to pay for the deposit, you will be instructed to ask them to Top-up their Sevi account before you can fill-out the OTP. Your customer receives an SMS with payment instructions as well including the amount, Paybill number and account number.

When the deposit amount is in your customers Sevi account, you can proceed with filling out the verification code (OTP).

When the verification code is correct the deposit amount is automatically deducted from your customers Sevi account. You are now ready to [deliver](/docs/seller/delivery/) the product.
