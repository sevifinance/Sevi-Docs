# Credit Limits

This section explains how **credit limits** work for sellers on Sevi and how they affect your buyers’ purchasing power.


## 1. What Are Credit Limits?

Credit limits define the **maximum amount a buyer can purchase on credit (Order Now, Pay Later)**.  

These limits are automatically set by Sevi. A buyer can order beyond its credit limit by paying the excess amount as a 'Pay Now' amount.

In addition you as a Seller also are assigned a limit. This limit defines the maximum outstanding credit of all your customers combined. 


## 2. How Buyer Limits Are Determined

Sevi evaluates multiple data points to assign fair and flexible credit limits to your buyers, including:
- Buyer’s **purchase history**.
- Buyer’s overall **shop performance**.
- **Your relationship and trade history** with the buyer.
- **Verification data** such as ID, location, and business statement details of the buyer.


## 3. Sharing Buyer Order History

Providing historical purchase data is optional, however, providing complete and accurate order information helps Sevi set more appropriate and higher limits for your buyers.

You can share or integrate buyer's historical purchase data with Sevi in two ways:

### a) Excel Upload via the admin portal
Manually upload historical purchase data using this [Excel template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BZK89VK8gNXYV0-RtY8sKykLYa8vEHpH/edit?gid=486363753#gid=486363753) and uploading it on the Seller portal. For further details, Checkout [Historical Sales Upload Guide](/docs/seller/admin/setting/sales)

### b) API Integration  
Automate the process through Sevi’s API.  
Visit the [Developer Documentation](/docs/developer/intro) for details on endpoints and integration steps.


## 4. Types of Credit Limits

There are three main limits that may temporarily restrict you from offering “Order Now, Pay Later”:

### a) **Seller limit**
- Restricts the **total unpaid credit amount** across all your buyers.  
- Once buyers repay, your available credit space opens up.  
- Maintaining a positive repayment record helps raise this limit over time.

### b) **Order Amount Exceeds Allowed Buyer Limit**
- Restricts the total amount your customer can buy on credit. 
- The more consistent your customer performs and repays as well as grows its shop, the higher this limit can grow.

### c) **Buyer’s Delinquency**
- If a buyer has overdue installments (with you or other sellers on Sevi), they will be **blocked temporarily from placing new orders on credit** until cleared.


## 5. Common Error Messages and What They Mean

| Error Message | Meaning | Recommended Action |
|----------------|----------|--------------------|
| **Seller reached max of outstanding installments** | You’ve hit your seller limit for active credit orders. | Wait for buyers to complete payments or contact Sevi Support. |
| **Buyer should first pay open installments** | Buyer has overdue installments. | Ask buyer to clear pending payments first. |
| **Order amount exceeds allowed buyer personal/company limit** | Buyer’s current credit limit has been reached. | Encourage timely repayment or advise them to apply for a limit review. |
<!-- | **Order amount exceeds allowed seller limit** | You’ve reached your maximum allowable credit exposure. | Improve repayment performance to increase the threshold. | -->


## 6. Maintaining Good Seller Standing

To grow your credit capacity and maintain smooth business operations:
- Encourage buyers to **pay installments on time**.  
- Maintain an **active trading history** with verified buyers.  
- Avoid repeated late payments or unresolved disputes.  

A strong seller record helps Sevi automatically expand your limit and buyer capacity over time.
