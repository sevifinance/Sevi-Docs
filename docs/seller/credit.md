# Credit Limits

This section explains how **credit limits** work for sellers on Sevi and how they affect your buyers’ purchasing power.


## 1. What Are Credit Limits?

Credit limits define the **maximum amount a buyer can purchase on credit (Order Now, Pay Later)** from your store.  
These limits are automatically calculated by Sevi based on both:
- Your track record as a seller.
- The buyer’s payment behavior and reliability.


## 2. How Buyer Limits Are Determined

Sevi evaluates multiple data points to assign fair and flexible limits to your buyers, including:
- **Buyer’s purchase history**
- **Your relationship and trade history** with the buyer.
- **Verification data** such as ID, location, and business statement details of the buyer.

Providing complete and accurate order information helps Sevi set appropriate and higher limits for your buyers.


## 3. Sharing Buyer Order History

You can share or integrate buyer order data with Sevi in two ways:

### a) Excel Upload  
Manually upload your order history using this [Excel template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BZK89VK8gNXYV0-RtY8sKykLYa8vEHpH/edit?gid=486363753#gid=486363753).

### b) API Integration  
Automate the process through Sevi’s API.  
Visit the [Developer Documentation](/docs/developer/intro) for details on REST endpoints and integration steps.


## 4. Types of Seller Credit Limits

There are three main limits that may temporarily restrict you from offering “Order Now, Pay Later”:

### a) **Maximum Outstanding Installments**
- Restricts the **total unpaid credit amount** across all your buyers.  
- Once buyers repay, your available credit space increases.  
- Maintaining a positive repayment record helps raise this limit over time.

### b) **Order Amount Exceeds Allowed Limit**
- Restricts the **size of individual orders** you can offer on credit.  
- The more consistent your performance and repayment collections, the higher this limit can grow.

### c) **Buyer’s Delinquency**
- If a buyer has overdue installments (with you or other sellers on Sevi), they will be **blocked from placing new orders on credit** until cleared.


## 5. Common Error Messages and What They Mean

| Error Message | Meaning | Recommended Action |
|----------------|----------|--------------------|
| **Seller reached max of outstanding installments** | You’ve hit your seller limit for active credit orders. | Wait for buyers to complete payments or contact Sevi Support. |
| **Buyer should first pay open installments** | Buyer has overdue installments. | Ask buyer to clear pending payments first. |
| **Order amount exceeds allowed buyer personal/company limit** | Buyer’s current Sevi limit has been reached. | Encourage timely repayment or advise them to apply for a limit review. |
| **Order amount exceeds allowed seller limit** | You’ve reached your maximum allowable credit exposure. | Improve repayment performance to increase the threshold. |


## 6. Maintaining Good Seller Standing

To grow your credit capacity and maintain smooth business operations:
- Encourage buyers to **pay installments on time**.  
- Maintain an **active trading history** with verified buyers.  
- Avoid repeated late payments or unresolved disputes.  

A strong seller record helps Sevi automatically expand your credit and buyer capacity over time.
