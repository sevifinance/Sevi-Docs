# Payment Status

Each payment request on Sevi goes through specific statuses from creation to completion.  
Here’s what each status means and what actions you can take:

| **Status** | **Meaning** | **Next Steps** |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Pending** | The payment request has been created and is awaiting buyer confirmation. | The buyer needs to review and confirm. You can still **edit** or **cancel** the request at this stage. |
| **Awaiting Shipment** | The buyer has confirmed the payment request, and the goods are ready for delivery. | Deliver the goods as agreed. Once confirmed by the buyer, Sevi releases your full payment. |
| **Delivered** | The goods have been successfully delivered to the buyer. | Sevi releases full payment to your seller wallet after buyer confirmation. The buyer then repays Sevi per their plan. |
| **Refunded** | The payment request has been cancelled or reversed, and the buyer’s funds have been reimbursed. | Review the reason for the refund. Contact **Sevi Support** if you need clarification. |
| **Archived** | The payment request is closed and removed from the active list. | This can happen if the buyer has reached their limit, has unpaid orders, or the request was rejected. Contact **Sevi Support** if unsure. |


:::tip
Only **Pending** payment requests can be **edited or cancelled**.  
Once moved to **Awaiting Shipment**, the request is locked for processing.
