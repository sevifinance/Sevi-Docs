# Edit/Cancel Payment Request

You can only **edit** or **cancel** a payment request **when its status is still Pending**.  
Once the buyer confirms or pays, the request can no longer be changed.


## 1. Open Payments Section
- Go to your **Payments** tab.  
- Tap on the payment request you want to manage.  
- You’ll see the order details and available actions at the bottom of the screen.

## 2. Edit a Payment Request
If you made a mistake in the order details (e.g. order amount):
- Tap **`Edit Payment`**.  
- Update the necessary field:
  - **Order Amount**
 
- Tap **`Save`** to update.

- Tap **`Cancel Payment`** on the same details screen.

Once cancelled:
- The payment request will be marked as **Cancelled** in your payment list.  
- The buyer will receive an **SMS notification** that the request was cancelled.  


## 4. Track Payment Status
After editing or cancelling, you can always check:
- **Pending** – Awaiting buyer confirmation.  
- **Awaiting Shipment** – Buyer confirmed the order and awaiting shipment.  
- **Cancelled** – Request cancelled before confirmation.  


:::caution
You cannot edit or cancel a payment request once it has been confirmed or paid by the buyer.
