## 2. Enter Order Details
On the order form, complete the following fields:  

- **Order Amount** → The total amount of the order. *(Mandatory)*  
- **Reference Number** → An internal or invoice reference for your order tracking.  
- **Payment Option**: *(Mandatory)*  
  - **Pay Later** → Buyer pays later as per the credit terms (Order Now, Pay Later).  
  - **Pay Directly** → Buyer pays immediately using M-Pesa to confirm the order.  
- **Select Buyer** → Choose the buyer for the order. *(Mandatory)*

Make sure the buyer’s phone number matches the one linked to their Sevi account.  
This ensures the request appears correctly on their end.

## 3. Send Payment Request
Once all details are confirmed:
- Tap **`Create Payment Request`**.  
- The buyer will receive an **SMS and in-app notification**.  
- The payment request will appear in your **Payments List** with a status of **Pending**.



## 4. Payment Confirmation
Once the buyer confirms and selects their payment option:
- If **Pay Later** → Sevi processes the credit and pays you immediately upon buyer confirmation.  
- If **Pay Directly** → payment is completed through M-Pesa instantly.  

You can track payment status under **Payments**.
