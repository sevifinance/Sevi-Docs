# Manage Team Members

The **Members** section allows a Seller to manage everyone who helps operate their Sevi account — from administrators to field agents.  

Each member added is assigned a **role** that defines what actions they can perform in the Sevi App or Seller Admin Portal.  


## Accessing the Members Section
1. From your Seller App, go to **Account Relations → Members**.  
2. You’ll see a list of all users under your seller account.  
3. Each entry shows:  
   - **Full Name**  
   - **Phone Number**  
   - **Role** (Admin, Member, or Agent)

## Member Roles Explained
| **Role** | **Access Rights** |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Admin** | Has full control over the seller account — can manage wallets, approve payments, add or remove members, and view all activities. |
| **Member** | Can access most seller features including managing customers, creating payment requests, and tracking activities, but **cannot access or manage the wallet**. |
| **Agent** | Typically a sales representative responsible for onboarding buyers, creating payment requests on behalf of customers, and managing on-ground relationships. |


## Adding a New Member
1. Tap **`+ Add New Member`**.  
2. Enter their **Phone Number**.  
4. Tap **`Invite`** to send an SMS invitation for them to join your seller account as a Member by default.


Once the invite is accepted, the user will automatically appear in your Members list with their assigned role.  


## Managing Existing Members
From the Members screen, you can:
- View all team members and their assigned roles.  
- Update a member’s role if their responsibilities change.  
- Remove a member when they no longer work with your business.

Keep your roles organized — assigning the right access helps protect your wallet and ensures smooth team operations.
