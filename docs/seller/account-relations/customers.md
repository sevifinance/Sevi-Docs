# Manage Customers

The **Customers** section allows you to view and manage all buyers linked to your Sevi Seller account.

## Viewing Your Buyers
1. From your Seller App, open the **Account Relations** section.  
2. Tap **Customers** to see a list of all buyers connected to your store.  
3. Each buyer entry displays:
   - **Buyer Name**
   - **Phone Number**
   - **Status** (Pending, Waiting On, Active, or Inactive)
   - **Credit Limit** (if already verified)

| **Status** | **Meaning** |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Pending** | Buyer has been invited but hasn’t completed registration. |
| **Waiting On** | Buyer completed initial registration and is awaiting verification. |
| **Active** | Buyer has been verified by Sevi’s due diligence team and is eligible for credit. |
| **Inactive** | Buyer has stopped transacting or was deactivated due to inactivity or default. |


## Adding a New Buyer
If you want to onboard a new customer:
1. Go to the **Customers** tab.  
2. Tap **`+ Add New Customer`**.  
3. Fill in their business details:  
   - Shop Name  
   - Phone Number  
4. Tap **`Add Customer`** to send them an SMS invitation with a link to download Sevi.

Once the buyer completes registration and verification, they’ll appear as **Active** in your list.

Encourage your buyers to keep their Sevi account active and verified.  
The more they transact, the higher their credit limits grow — and the more sales you make.
