# Seller FAQs

Here are some common questions sellers ask while using Sevi:


## 1. I donâ€™t see any payment plan options for my buyer. Why?
Possible reasons:
- Your company has reached its **maximum outstanding credit limit**.  
- The buyer already has another **active or unpaid credit**.  
- The buyerâ€™s **credit score** is low or negative.  
- Some company or buyer details are **missing or unverified**.  

ðŸ‘‰ Contact [Sevi Support](/docs/about/support) for assistance.  


## 2. My customer canâ€™t pay on time â€” what happens next?
When a buyer fails to pay on time:
- They have a **3-day grace period** per installment.  
- During these days, Sevi sends regular **reminder messages** and additional interest is charged.  
- After 3 days, a **late fee** is applied and youâ€™ll be notified through the dashboard.  
- Our tele-collection and field collection team will follow up with the Buyer to pay the overdue amount.  
- After **90 days**, the account is marked as **default** and may be reported to the CRB.  
- If too many of your customers default, your company may **temporarily lose access to Sevi credit services**.  

See [Terms & Conditions](/termsConditions) for full details.  


## 3. How does a buyer qualify for Order now, Pay later?
Sevi determines who qualifies based on:
- Buyerâ€™s **purchase history**.  
- Buyerâ€™s overall **shop performance**.  
- Your **relationship and trade history** with the buyer.  
- **Verification data** such as ID, location, and business statement details of the buyer. 


## 4. I or my buyer didnâ€™t receive the verification SMS (OTP). What should I do?
- Confirm that the **phone number** was entered correctly.  
- Tap **Resend OTP** to send a new code.  
- Ensure the customer hasnâ€™t blocked SMS from Sevi or **AfricasTalking**.  
- If still not received, contact [Sevi Support](/docs/about/support).  


## 5. I forgot my PIN. How can I reset it?
- Contact [Sevi Support](/docs/about/support) via phone or WhatsApp.  
- Youâ€™ll be asked to provide a **copy of your ID** to verify ownership before the PIN is reset.  


## 6. My device is not supported. What can I do?
- The Sevi app supports **Android version 5.0 and above**.  
- iPhone and Windows versions are coming soon.  
- If you donâ€™t have a smartphone, your **agent** can perform actions on your behalf through their Sevi app.  


## 7. What do the different order statuses mean?

ðŸ‘‰ You can also view status updates from the **Payments** tab in your Sevi app or admin portal.  


## 8. What happens if my account details are outdated or incorrect?
If your company details (e.g., KRA PIN, bank info, contact email) are missing or outdated, it may delay payouts or verification.  
Contact [Sevi Support](/docs/about/support) to update your details safely.  


## 9. How can I increase my companyâ€™s limit?
Maintain a positive record:
