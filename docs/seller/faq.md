# Seller FAQs

Here are some common questions sellers ask while using Sevi:


## 1. I donâ€™t see any payment plan options for my buyer. Why?
Possible reasons:
- Your company has reached its **maximum outstanding credit limit**.  
- The buyer already has another **active or unpaid credit**.  
- The buyerâ€™s **credit score** is low or negative.  
- Some company or buyer details are **missing or unverified**.  

ðŸ‘‰ Contact [Sevi Support](/docs/about/support) for assistance.  


## 2. My customer canâ€™t pay on time â€” what happens next?
When a buyer fails to pay on time:
- They have a **7-day grace period** per installment.  
- During these days, Sevi sends regular **reminder messages**.  
- After 7 days, a **late fee** is applied and youâ€™ll be notified through the dashboard.  
- After **90 days**, the account is marked as **default**, handed over to debt collection, and may be reported to the CRB.  
- If too many of your customers default, your company may **temporarily lose access to Sevi credit services**.  

See [Terms & Conditions](/termsConditions) for full details.  


## 3. How does a buyer qualify for payment in installments?
As a seller, you determine who qualifies based on:
- **Trust relationship** and repayment discipline.  
- **Buying and payment history** with your business.  
- **Membership in a trading or loan group**.  
- **Group size or credibility** (some sellers require a minimum group size).  


## 4. I or my buyer didnâ€™t receive the verification SMS (OTP). What should I do?
- Confirm that the **phone number** was entered correctly.  
- Tap **Resend OTP** to send a new code.  
- Ensure the customer hasnâ€™t blocked SMS from Sevi or **AfricasTalking**.  
- If still not received, contact [Sevi Support](/docs/about/support).  


## 5. I forgot my PIN. How can I reset it?
- Contact [Sevi Support](/docs/about/support) via phone or WhatsApp.  
- Youâ€™ll be asked to provide a **copy of your ID** to verify ownership before the PIN is reset.  


## 6. My device is not supported. What can I do?
- The Sevi app supports **Android version 5.0 and above**.  
- iPhone and Windows versions are coming soon.  
- If you donâ€™t have a smartphone, your **agent** can perform actions on your behalf through their Sevi app.  


## 7. What do the different order statuses mean?
Hereâ€™s what each order status represents:

| **Status** | **Meaning** |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Pending** | The payment request has been created but not yet confirmed by the buyer. |
| **Purchased** | The buyer has selected a payment plan and paid any required deposit. |
| **Delivered** | The order has been delivered to the buyer. Sevi releases payment to you upon buyer confirmation. |

ðŸ‘‰ You can also view status updates from the **Payments** tab in your Sevi app or admin portal.  


## 8. What happens if my account details are outdated or incorrect?
If your company details (e.g., KRA PIN, bank info, contact email) are missing or outdated, it may delay payouts or verification.  
Contact [Sevi Support](/docs/about/support) to update your details safely.  


## 9. How can I increase my companyâ€™s credit limit?
Maintain a positive record:
- Encourage buyers to **repay on time**.  
- Keep your **seller wallet active**.  
- Avoid high default rates among your buyers.  
Over time, Sevi automatically adjusts your credit limit based on performance.
