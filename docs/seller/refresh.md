# Refresh data

When you performed an action in the app and you don't see the data on your screen change, you can always refresh the data. There are two ways to do this:

## Pull down screen
Press you screen anywhere and pull down your screen. This will show you a rotating arrow in your screen, meaning the data is being refreshed.

## Close app
If this function isn't working on your phone, you can close the app and open it again. This will fetch the latest data for you.
