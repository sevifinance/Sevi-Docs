Sell more products by providing an ‘Order now, Pay later’ option to your customers. Let your customers order the products they want now, but pay later. It is hassle free as Sevi provides the credit line, does the KYC and follows up on payments. [Apply now!](/docs/seller/apply/)

“Sell on credit, get paid 80% on delivery”
:::

Even though you are selling on credit, you get paid 80% of the order value on delivery. The remaining balance is settled when your customer pays the final instalment. 

Sevi facilitates the payment option of Order now, Pay later. You remain in control of your products, pricing and customer relations.
