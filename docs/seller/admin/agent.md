# Agent Management

The **Sales Reps** section in the Seller Admin Portal allows you to add, edit, and manage all your sales representatives (agents) who help onboard buyers, process payments, and handle field activities.  

This page helps you organize your sales network, monitor active agents, and manage their access to Sevi services.  


## Overview

Once added, the agent will appear in your list with the status **Inactive** until activated for them to be able to withdraw their incentives.


## Managing Agents

From the Agents table, you can:
- **Activate / Deactivate** an agent based on their current role.  
- **Edit** agent details such as name, phone number, or mapping tags.  
- **Remove** an agent if they no longer represent your company.  
- **Search** for agents by name or phone number.  
- **Export** your full agent list to Excel for record keeping or reporting.  


## Mapping Tags

Mapping tags help you organize your agent network efficiently.  
They can represent **regions**, **buyer groups**, or **sales territories**.  

By assigning matching tags:
- Agents can only manage buyers linked to the same tag.
- It ensures clear accountability and organized field coverage.  

:::tip
Use mapping tags consistently to streamline your team structure and improve tracking of agent performance.

The **Agent Management** feature gives you a simple yet powerful way to manage your sales team — from adding and updating agents to assigning responsibilities and monitoring activity in one centralized place.
