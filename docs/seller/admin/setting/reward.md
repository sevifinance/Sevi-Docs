# Customer Loyalty Program

The **Customer Loyalty Rewards Program** in the Sevi platform is designed to strengthen relationships between sellers and their customers.  
It converts small transaction fees into redeemable reward points, encouraging repeat purchases and long-term loyalty — all at **no extra cost to sellers**.

## Key Benefits

| **For Buyers** | **For Sellers** |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Earn reward points with every completed order. | Increase customer loyalty and retention. |
| Redeem points on future purchases. | Boost repeat orders and long-term relationships. |
| Track and redeem rewards easily in the app. | Enjoy the benefits automatically — no setup cost. |


## How It Works

### Earning Rewards
1. When a customer completes an order, the **transaction fee** is automatically converted into **reward points**.  
2. The points are added instantly to the customer’s account balance.  
3. Reward points are **specific to each seller** — they can only be redeemed with the seller who issued them.  

### Redeeming Rewards
- Customers can redeem their accumulated points on future purchases.  
- Redemption is automatic — applied directly during checkout.  
- Buyers can also choose to continue accumulating points for bigger discounts later.  


## Example Transaction

| **Stage** | **Details** |
|------------|-------------|
| **Initial Purchase** |  |
| Order Amount | KES 10,000 |
| Transaction Fee | KES 220 |
| **Rewards Earned** | KES 220 worth of points |
| **Subsequent Purchase** |  |
| Order Amount | KES 10,000 |
| Transaction Fee | KES 220 |
| Rewards Applied | -KES 220 |
| **Total Paid** | KES 10,000 |
