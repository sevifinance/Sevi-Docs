# Create a Payment Request (Admin Portal)

The **Payment Request** section in the Seller Admin Portal allows sellers to create and send payment requests to their buyers.  
This feature enables you to receive payments through **Sevi Credit (Pay Later)** or **Direct Pay** options selected by buyers.


## How to Create a Payment Request

### 1. Open the Orders Page
From your Admin Portal menu, go to **Orders** and click the **`+`** button at the top-right.  
This will open a pop-up window titled **“Add New Payment Request(s)”**.

### 2. Fill in the Payment Details
In the modal window, complete the following fields:

| **Field** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Invoice** | The invoice or order reference number. *(Required)* |
| **Customer** | Type the buyer’s name or phone number to select them. *(Required)* |
| **Value (KES)** | The total amount for this order or invoice. *(Required)* |
| **Payment** | Auto-calculated based on buyer eligibility and Sevi credit settings. |
| **Sales Rep** | (Optional) Assign the sales representative handling this order. You can search by name or phone number. |

click **`Add`** to load the payment request into the list.

### 3. Add More Requests (Optional)
If you need to create multiple requests at once:
- Repeat the above steps and click **`Add`** after each entry.  
- Each added request will appear in a summarized list within the modal.


### 4. Submit the Requests
Once all requests are ready and verified:
- Click **`Add Requests`** at the bottom of the modal.  
- The buyer(s) will receive **SMS notification** prompting them to confirm and choose their payment option in their Sevi App.


## What Happens Next
- The created requests will appear under the **Orders** or **Payments** list with the status **Pending**.  
- Once the buyer confirms and selects their payment plan, the request will automatically update to **Approved** or **Paid** depending on the payment type.

## Tips
- Always ensure the buyer’s phone number matches their Sevi account to avoid delivery errors.  
- Double-check all values before submitting — payment requests cannot be edited after they are sent and confirmed.  
- For multiple orders, review the summary carefully to confirm all invoice numbers and amounts.

The **Payment Request** feature gives sellers a fast, reliable way to bill customers directly from the Admin Portal — streamlining transactions and ensuring buyers receive real-time Sevi payment notifications.
