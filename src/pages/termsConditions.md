# Terms & Conditions (Buyers)

## 1. Order now, Pay later

1.1 These terms constitute a legally binding agreement between Sevi Innovation Limited including its foreign subsidiaries and branches (“Sevi”, “we” or “us”) and the person or legal entity or institution (“you” or “Buyer”) who makes a purchase from our partner sellers (“Sellers”).

1.2 If you choose the Sevi payment option (“Order now, Pay later”) on the Sevi Mobile App, Website, USSD, SMS or WhatsApp (“Sevi Platform”) or on a Seller’s platform you acknowledge that you have carefully read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these terms and conditions (“Terms”), as amended from time to time.

1.3 If you are using the Sevi Platform on behalf of a third party, including, without limitation, any business entity, you warrant that you are authorised and have the authority to commit the third party to these Terms. If you are not duly authorized by the third party, you acknowledge that you will be personally liable for any purported authorization of the third party and any resulting obligations or liabilities arising from unauthorized use of the Sevi services.

1.4 If you do not agree to these Terms, you must stop using or accessing the Sevi Platform immediately.

1.5 You can at any time access and print a copy of these terms via our website for your record.

1.6 The Order now, Pay later is a payment option you can choose on a Seller’s checkout platform or, where the partner Seller does not have a digital sale platform, from the Sevi Platform to part pay your purchases on credit by dividing the purchase price (“Purchase Price) into one or multiple payments.

## 2. How do I Order now, Pay later?

2.1 To create a Sevi account (“Sevi Account”) download the Sevi app and fill out your personal data for verification purposes. Once a personal account is created, you can create a company account as an authorised representative of the company, top-up and withdraw your Sevi Account from or to your mobile money or bank account.

2.2 Our approval of your application to use the Order now, Pay later payment option to pay for products brought from a Seller will be subject to our review of your data and circumstances you provide when creating the Sevi Account. We explicitly reserve the right, at our absolute discretion, to decline your application for or use of the Order now, Pay later service at any time without giving reasons for doing so.

2.3 For each purchase you want to use the Order now, Pay later option for, you must agree to the specific payment terms relating to the Order now, Pay later payment plan applicable to the relevant purchase transaction as displayed on the Seller checkout or Sevi Platform.

2.4 You acknowledge that you may need to pay a down payment (“deposit”) either from your Sevi Account or from M-Pesa for you to use the Order now, Pay later payment option.

2.5 Deposit is defined as the sum of money that you as a Buyer pay at the start of the purchase. The deposit represents a portion of the total Purchase Price. On the Sevi Platform, this deposit is described as the "Pay now" amount.

2.6 Credit is defined as the sum of money that you as the Buyer pay at a later time to us, to finance the remainder of the Purchase Price. On the Sevi Platform, this is described as the "Pay later" amount. This Pay later amount is lower or equal to the Credit Limit.

2.7 The Credit Limit is the total Pay later part of the purchase amount available to you for purchases with Sellers using our Order now, Pay later payment option and the available limit reduces each time when you make a purchase and increases when you repay a credit. This Credit Limit is set at the sole discretion of Sevi and will be displayed on your Sevi Account when you login onto the Sevi Platform.

2.8 Once you accept the Order now, Pay later payment plan and your Sevi Account has sufficient balance to pay the Pay now amount, we will debit the Pay now amount from your Sevi account. Once the goods are delivered, we pay the Seller, on your behalf, the entire or part of the Purchase Price for the products you purchased. You agree to repay the Pay later part of the Purchase Price to us in full on the instalment dates determined in accordance with these Terms. Sevi will debit the remaining payments from your Sevi Account on the due date of each instalment, or you can pay an instalment directly through the payment link. We will send you this payment link and remind you on the due dates via electronic communication (e.g. SMS/push notification). The amount due and the instalment dates are viewable on the Sevi platform.

2.9 You give us the authority to debit the remaining instalment payments from your Sevi Account on and after the due dates. When you switch on the function to sweep any wallet top-up to any open credit, you give us the authority to debit the remaining instalment payments from your Sevi Account also before the due dates.

2.10 In the event the Seller or Sellers do not charge you for your entire order at the same time, we will create a different Order now, Pay later plan for each order part. This situation may be common where a Seller does not ship all the items from your order at the same time.

2.11 You will maintain an adequate credit balance on your Sevi Account to allow for payments to be taken on the due dates, if you choose not to use the provided payment link. **It is important you ensure enough funds are available to complete your payment on the due date**.

3.2 You are authorised to make a purchase on credit on behalf of the entity you represent.

3.8 The number of instalments, interest and amount per instalment will be clearly communicated before entering into any payment option and can be reviewed in the Sevi app at any time. The period starts on confirmation by you and/or the Seller of delivery and ends on the due date of the final instalment (“Period”).

3.9 When you confirm to agree with these Terms, if applicable, the first payment (“Deposit”) is taken from your Sevi Account. If we, for any reason, are unable to charge the deposit from your Sevi Account, the Seller will not hand over the product to you.

3.10 You authorize us to store your ID and phone number details on our systems. We will use this information to authorize future payments under these Terms. You may manage your profile and details through the Sevi app. Data that has already been verified cannot be altered unless the new data is verified again by Sevi.

3.11 If you and the Seller cancel your purchase during the Period, we will cancel any remaining payments and pay back to your Sevi Account any amounts we have taken and are refunded to us by the Seller. Any part returns and refunded to us by the Seller will reduce your outstanding balance. Any cancellation or refunds after the Period is the responsibility of the Seller and therefore between you and the Seller. In this case no interest nor fees paid to Sevi are refunded.

3.12 You are responsible for being able to receive SMS messages sent by Sevi through our SMS service provider Africa’s Talking or any replacement service provider. Missed messages can never be an excuse for paying late.

## 4. Right to repay early

4.1 You are entitled, to pay any instalment earlier than the due date. In the Sevi app, you go to your Order overview and per instalment you can click “Pay”. Clicking this button pays that specific instalment, provided the balance in your Sevi Account is enough. If the balance in your Sevi Account is not sufficient, you are asked to first top-up your Sevi Account. You may also choose to switch on the option to automatically sweep any wallet top-up to any open credit even before due date.

## 5. Consequences of default and missed payments

5.1 If we are not able to debit an instalment amount from your Sevi Account on the due date, we might provide you a courtesy slack period of 24 hours, so that you can top-up your Sevi Account. After 1 day late, you will be charged a late fee of 2% per day of the outstanding amount, up to a cumulative 6% by day 6. Paying late might also influence future decisions regarding future payment products that will be made available to you.

5.2 You will be notified in good time via electronic communication to your verified phone number, about the payment failure so you’ll have enough time to make sure that you have sufficient funds in your Sevi Account.

5.3 If you fail to make a payment on or before the due date, you may be unable to use the service in the future. We continue to attempt to collect overdue and currently due payments on subsequent due dates. You can pay any defaulted instalment at any time during the Period.

5.4 If you fail to make a payment on a due date, you acknowledge that Sevi has the right to require you to pay the remaining total amount of all outstanding instalments immediately and exercise any of its rights in accordance with the law without any further reference to you. This may involve Sevi engaging internal debt collector, external debt collection agency, taking possession of and selling the financed goods or instructing auctioneers to collect the outstanding amount. The cost for collection will be charged to you.

5.5 If you fail to pay any or all instalments for over 21 days, a default fee of 10% is added to the total credit amount.

We may ask for additional security.

5.7 If you fail to pay, the Seller, Sevi debt collector, debt collection agency and/or our auctioneer may enter your premises during reasonable hours to retrieve the goods purchased using Sevi’s services or any other collateral given by you as security under these Terms. Therefore, use the purchase properly and do not modify or alter them. You shall not remove or alter identification or registration numbers on the purchase. You are responsible for loss of, or damage to the purchase. In such case you need to notify us. You are responsible for insurance of the purchase, insurance is applicable to items purchased above a certain amount and this option will be presented as a checkbox or otherwise prior to agreeing to these Terms.

5.8 You acknowledge that repossession of the financed goods shall not relieve you of your obligation to pay the outstanding amount, including any accrued interest and fees. Sevi may choose to resell the repossessed goods, and any proceeds from such resale will be applied towards the outstanding balance. You shall be liable for any deficiency between the outstanding balance and the proceeds from the resale.

5.9 Missing payments can have serious consequences for you. Your Sevi Credit Limit will be affected which will make it more difficult or more expensive for you to obtain credit in the future.
