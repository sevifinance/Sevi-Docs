1.4 If you do not agree to these Terms, you must stop using or accessing the Sevi Platform immediately.

1.5 You can at any time access and print a copy of these terms via our website for your record.

1.6 The Order now, Pay later is a payment option you can choose on a Seller’s checkout platform or, where the partner Seller does not have a digital sale platform, from the Sevi Platform to part pay your purchases on credit by dividing the purchase price (“Purchase Price) into one or multiple payments.

## 2. How do I Order now, Pay later?

2.1 To create a Sevi account (“Sevi Account”) download the Sevi app and fill out your personal data for verification purposes. Once a personal account is created, you can create a company account as an authorised representative of the company, top-up and withdraw your Sevi Account from or to your mobile money or bank account.

2.2 Our approval of your application to use the Order now, Pay later payment option to pay for products brought from a Seller will be subject to our review of your data and circumstances you provide when creating the Sevi Account. We explicitly reserve the right, at our absolute discretion, to decline your application for or use of the Order now, Pay later service at any time without giving reasons for doing so.

2.3 For each purchase you want to use the Order now, Pay later option for, you must agree to the specific payment terms relating to the Order now, Pay later payment plan applicable to the relevant purchase transaction as displayed on the Seller checkout or Sevi Platform.

2.4 You acknowledge that you may need to pay a down payment (“deposit”) either from your Sevi Account or from M-Pesa for you to use the Order now, Pay later payment option.

2.5 Deposit is defined as the sum of money that you as a Buyer pay at the start of the purchase. The deposit represents a portion of the total Purchase Price. On the Sevi Platform, this deposit is described as the "Pay now" or "Pay direct" amount.

2.6 Credit is defined as the sum of money that you as the Buyer pay at a later time to us, to finance the remainder of the Purchase Price. On the Sevi Platform, this is described as the "Pay later" amount. This Pay later amount is lower or equal to the Credit Limit.

2.7 The Credit Limit is the total Pay later part of the purchase amount available to you for purchases with Sellers using our Order now, Pay later payment option and the available limit reduces each time when you make a purchase and increases when you repay a credit. This Credit Limit is set at the sole discretion of Sevi and will be displayed on your Sevi Account when you login onto the Sevi Platform.

2.8 Once you accept the Order now, Pay later payment plan and your Sevi Account has sufficient balance to pay the Pay now amount, we will debit the Pay now amount from your Sevi account. We pay the Seller, on your behalf, the entire or part of the Purchase Price for the products you purchased. You agree to repay the Pay later part of the Purchase Price to us in full on the instalment dates determined in accordance with these Terms. Sevi will debit the remaining payments from your Sevi Account on the due date of each instalment, or you can pay an instalment directly through the payment link. We will send you this payment link and remind you on the due dates via electronic communication (e.g. SMS/push notification). The amount due and the instalment dates are viewable on the Sevi platform.

2.9 You give us the authority to debit the remaining instalment payments from your Sevi Account on and after the due dates. Or you can choose to repay early, see 'Right to repay early'.

2.10 In the event the Seller or Sellers do not charge you for your entire order at the same time, we will create a different Order now, Pay later plan for each order part. This situation may be common where a Seller does not ship all the items from your order at the same time.

2.11 You will maintain an adequate credit balance on your Sevi Account to allow for payments to be taken on the due dates, if you choose not to use the provided payment link. **It is important you ensure enough funds are available to complete your payment on the due date**.

2.12 You may want to pre pay your interest on a monthly basis. Pre-paying your monthly interest will allow you to process as many 'Order now, Pay later' purchases during the respective month at a fixed interest. When you opt in for this option, you allow us to debit the pre-paid interest from your Sevi Account, when the monthly interest is due. You are able to stop this pre-paid interest option at any point of time. The credit limit and additional interest on late payments remain in effect.
